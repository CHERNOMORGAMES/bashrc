# ~/.bashrc
My Bash aliases and functions collection, making Bash in terminal emulator much more friendly and convenient.  
New linux users will find here almost all bash commands they might require, without need for googling them.  
Remember to use `man <your command>` and `<your command> --help`.  
Experienced users might appreciate my _sudo_ and _search_ functions and maybe some other things.  
## For now, cool stuff is:
* __alias sudo__ - combined from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72961859/14167912) and improved to invoke almost anything (only alias _now_ aint working)
* alias ls - cool looking, time and type based
* all kinds of cd, cdls, rm, mkdir, e.t.c.
* alias delete - move to trash (or restore) from terminal (for gnome only)
* __alias search__ - filename[str](use '*' for wildcards), startdepth[int]: solving slow find problem by prompting each depth level, really proud of it!
* alias check - lookup files for text insertions and show changetime based files list
* alias match - lookup files for text insertions and show each insertion with string number
* __alias cd__ - makes cd + ls + pwd, using cool ls and showing current path - never saw it in other repos all at once



* other stuff - kinda constantly improving my collection...
